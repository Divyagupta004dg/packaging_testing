# **Module 1:**

# **Evolution of Semiconductor Packaging â€“ From Fundamentals to Advanced Integration**


Why is Semiconductor Packaging Needed?
Modern ICs are born in ultra-clean fabs as fragile bare dies. Before these can enter our phones, laptops, and cars, they must be packaged to:

 Protect the die (corrosion, moisture, physical shock)

 Enable connectivity with the real world
 
ðŸ”— The die is the heart of every semiconductor device â€” it's the tiny square or rectangular piece of silicon that holds the actual integrated circuit (IC). All the transistors, logic gates, memory cells, and functional units are etched into this small chip during the fabrication process.

# Module 2:

# From Silicon Wafer to Complete Package â€“ Assembly and Fabrication Processes

 # 1 Review of the Supply Chain
This outlines the key stages in the semiconductor supply chain, detailing the flow from initial design to the final product

. Design House: The process begins with designing integrated circuits (ICs) using EDA tools and foundry PDKs. The output is an IC design file (GDSII) and a test program.

. Wafer Fabrication: Silicon wafers are manufactured using specialized equipment, gases, chemicals, and materials. The result is a wafer with fabricated ICs.

. Package Assembly and Test: Individual ICs are separated from the wafer, assembled into packages with substrates and other materials, and tested for quality.

. Board Assembly and Test: Multiple packaged ICs are mounted onto printed circuit boards (PCBs), assembled using various tools and materials, and then tested.

. Product Assembly and Test: The final stage involves assembling the tested boards and other components into the end product, such as a smartphone, which undergoes final testing before reaching the market.

Each stage is crucial for ensuring the performance and reliability of the final electronic product.

# 3  Wire Bond Packaging Process in Semiconductor Manufacturing

This process is part of the back-end semiconductor manufacturing flow, where individual dies are packaged and made ready for integration on PCBs.

KEY STEPS:

1.Die Attach

  . Epoxy is dispensed.

  . The chip is picked and placed onto a substrate using Die Attach Film (DAF).

2.Curing

  . The epoxy is hardened by controlled heating to ensure strong bonding between die and substrate.

3.Wire Bonding

  . Fine gold or aluminum wires connect the die to the package pins using ultrasonic welding and thermal compression.

4.Molding (Transfer Molding)

  . The assembly is encapsulated using a mold compound, protecting the die and wires with resin flow.

5.Marking

  . The package is laser-marked for identification and traceability.

6.Singulation

  . The wafer is diced into individual packaged units using a precision blade.

# 4 Flip Chip Packaging Process â€“ Mass Reflow & Thermo-Compression
Flip Chip Packaging is a modern method of mounting a semiconductor die face-down onto the package substrate using solder bumps. It is different from traditional wire bonding and offers better electrical, thermal, and mechanical performance.

# Why Are Bumps Needed?
Solder bumps (also called micro-bumps) replace wires in this approach.

They:

1.Provide direct electrical connections between the chip and substrate.

2.Allow shorter signal paths â†’ higher speed and lower inductance.

3.Enable higher I/O density.

4.Offer better thermal dissipation.

# Flip Chip Flow: Key Steps
1. Bump Formation on Silicon Die
â€¢ Solder bumps are deposited on the die's bond pads.
â€¢ After reflow, bumps solidify and prepare the chip for mounting.

2. Flip the Chip
â€¢ The die is flipped upside-down to face the substrate for bump contact.

3. Flux Dispensing
â€¢ Flux is applied on the substrate to aid in soldering and oxidation removal.

4. Chip Placement
â€¢ The chip is placed carefully over the substrate, aligning the bumps with pads.

5. Solder Reflow
â€¢ Heat is applied to melt the solder bumps and form solid electrical connections.

6. Flux Cleaning
â€¢ Residual flux is removed using solvents to avoid contamination.

7. Underfill Dispensing
â€¢ Epoxy is filled between the die and substrate to:
â€“ Improve mechanical strength
â€“ Distribute thermal stress
â€“ Prevent solder crack failures

8. Underfill Curing
â€¢ The epoxy is hardened by heating, locking the chip in place

9. Molding
â€¢ Resin is applied for external protection from environmental damage.

10. Marking
â€¢ Laser is used to inscribe IDs or codes for tracking and quality assurance.

11. Ball Mounting & Final Reflow
â€¢ BGA balls are mounted under the package and soldered for PCB connection.

# 5 Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) with RDL â€“ Fan-Out Flow
Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) is an advanced packaging technology where chips are packaged while still part of the wafer. It enables compact, high-performance, low-cost chip integration â€” especially for mobile and IoT devices.

# What is RDL (Redistribution Layer) & Why It's Important?
RDL (Redistribution Layer) is a critical metallization layer added during WLP:

. Reroutes I/O pads to new positions to allow larger solder ball pitch.

. Enables fan-out designs (area beyond original die).

. Allows more I/Os in smaller form factor.

. Improves electrical performance and design flexibility.

Steps:

1. Reconstitution	:  Allows known good dies to be used in a new wafer panel

2. RDL (Redistribution Layer)	: Enables fine-pitch routing and bump placement

3. Dielectric + Metal Coating: 	Forms the electrical routing infrastructure

4. Solder Ball Attach: 	Provides final I/O connections to PCB

5. Singulation: 	Final step to separate packages from reconstituted wafer
