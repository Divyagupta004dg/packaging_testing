Packaging -fundamentals and testing

This repository highlights the immersive technical journey undertaken by Divya Gupta during a specialized training on advanced semiconductor assembly and verification techniques. The experience was crafted to bridge theory and practice — offering a modern perspective on how chips transition from wafer to system. The learning pathway spanned high-density integration strategies like 2.5D and 3D packaging, multilayer routing with RDLs, and component linking via interposers. In parallel, hands-on labs using ANSYS simulation tools brought packaging challenges to life through real-time modeling of heat distribution, mechanical stress, and structural optimization. This repository serves as both a personal documentation space and a knowledge vault for fellow enthusiasts and learners.

# **Evolution of Semiconductor Packaging – From Fundamentals to Advanced Integration**


Why is Semiconductor Packaging Needed?
Modern ICs are born in ultra-clean fabs as fragile bare dies. Before these can enter our phones, laptops, and cars, they must be packaged to:

 Protect the die (corrosion, moisture, physical shock)

 Enable connectivity with the real world
 
🔗 The die is the heart of every semiconductor device — it's the tiny square or rectangular piece of silicon that holds the actual integrated circuit (IC). All the transistors, logic gates, memory cells, and functional units are etched into this small chip during the fabrication process.

Packaging Example: BGA (Ball Grid Array)
