Packaging -fundamentals and testing

This repository highlights the immersive technical journey undertaken by Divya Gupta during a specialized training on advanced semiconductor assembly and verification techniques. The experience was crafted to bridge theory and practice â€” offering a modern perspective on how chips transition from wafer to system. The learning pathway spanned high-density integration strategies like 2.5D and 3D packaging, multilayer routing with RDLs, and component linking via interposers. In parallel, hands-on labs using ANSYS simulation tools brought packaging challenges to life through real-time modeling of heat distribution, mechanical stress, and structural optimization. This repository serves as both a personal documentation space and a knowledge vault for fellow enthusiasts and learners.

# **Evolution of Semiconductor Packaging â€“ From Fundamentals to Advanced Integration**


Why is Semiconductor Packaging Needed?
Modern ICs are born in ultra-clean fabs as fragile bare dies. Before these can enter our phones, laptops, and cars, they must be packaged to:

 Protect the die (corrosion, moisture, physical shock)

 Enable connectivity with the real world
 
ðŸ”— The die is the heart of every semiconductor device â€” it's the tiny square or rectangular piece of silicon that holds the actual integrated circuit (IC). All the transistors, logic gates, memory cells, and functional units are etched into this small chip during the fabrication process.

# Product Requirements in Semiconductor Packaging

ðŸ§© Understanding the Chip-to-Board Flow

The image illustrates the integration hierarchy from the die (chip) to the final PCB (board):   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/324b3d76-96d5-4ca9-92e5-14bd33593519)

Chip: The silicon die containing the core logic.

Package: Encapsulates the die and provides external I/O access.

Board (PCB): Hosts the packaged components and connects them to other system parts.

Packaging Example: BGA (Ball Grid Array) ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a63531f9-5c8e-4caf-adfe-d9580024324a)

Below hierarchical structure of electronic integrationâ€”from chip to package to boardâ€”highlighting the critical role of packaging in connecting and protecting semiconductor devices. The right side presents key factors in choosing the right package, including:

Application type (logic, memory, power)
Form factor
Reliability and durability
Cost
Thermal dissipation
Pin count (I/O pins)

# Package Structure
This diagram illustrates the typical structure of an electronic package, which serves as a bridge between the silicon die and the system board (PCB). Key components include:

Mold compound: Protects the internal components from environmental damage.
Die: The actual semiconductor chip performing the electronic functions.
Die-to-carrier interconnections: Enable electrical connectivity between the die and the carrier.
Carrier: Provides mechanical support and routing for signals.
Carrier-to-board interconnections: Link the package to the system board.
System Board (PCB): The final platform where the package is mounted and integrated into the device.
