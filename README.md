Packaging -fundamentals and testing

This repository highlights the immersive technical journey undertaken by Divya Gupta during a specialized training on advanced semiconductor assembly and verification techniques. The experience was crafted to bridge theory and practice â€” offering a modern perspective on how chips transition from wafer to system. The learning pathway spanned high-density integration strategies like 2.5D and 3D packaging, multilayer routing with RDLs, and component linking via interposers. In parallel, hands-on labs using ANSYS simulation tools brought packaging challenges to life through real-time modeling of heat distribution, mechanical stress, and structural optimization. This repository serves as both a personal documentation space and a knowledge vault for fellow enthusiasts and learners.

# **Evolution of Semiconductor Packaging â€“ From Fundamentals to Advanced Integration**


Why is Semiconductor Packaging Needed?
Modern ICs are born in ultra-clean fabs as fragile bare dies. Before these can enter our phones, laptops, and cars, they must be packaged to:

 Protect the die (corrosion, moisture, physical shock)

 Enable connectivity with the real world
 
ðŸ”— The die is the heart of every semiconductor device â€” it's the tiny square or rectangular piece of silicon that holds the actual integrated circuit (IC). All the transistors, logic gates, memory cells, and functional units are etched into this small chip during the fabrication process.

# Package Structure
This diagram illustrates the typical structure of an electronic package, which serves as a bridge between the silicon die and the system board (PCB). Key components include:

Mold compound: Protects the internal components from environmental damage.

Die: The actual semiconductor chip performing the electronic functions.

Die-to-carrier interconnections: Enable electrical connectivity between the die and the carrier.

# Types of Packaging
Electronic component packaging is essential for protecting semiconductor devices and enabling their integration into systems. Packaging types are broadly classified into Through-Hole Mounting and Surface Mount Technology (SMT). Each type offers unique benefits in terms of size, performance, and application.

1. Through-Hole Mounting

DIP (Dual In-line Package): Rectangular package with two rows of pins for insertion into a PCB.

TO (Transistor Outline): Cylindrical or flat package for transistors with leads extending from the bottom.

PGA (Pin Grid Array): Package with a grid of pins underneath for socket or solder mounting.

2. Surface Mount Technology (SMT)

QFN (Quad Flat No-lead): Leadless package with solder pads underneath for compact mounting.

QFP (Quad Flat Package): Flat square package with leads on all four sides.

CSP (Chip Scale Package): Ultra-compact package nearly the same size as the chip itself.

PBGA (Plastic Ball Grid Array): BGA package using plastic substrate with solder balls underneath.

LGA (Land Grid Array): Package with flat contact pads instead of pins for board connection.

PoP (Package on Package): Stacked ICs in a single package to save space and enhance performance.

MCM (Multi-Chip Module): Multiple chips integrated into one module for higher functionality.

CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate): Advanced 2.5D packaging integrating chips on a silicon interposer.

# Anatomy of Packaging
Semiconductor packaging is categorized into Leadframe, Laminate, and Advanced package substrates, each offering different levels of complexity, performance, and integration. These packages protect the chip, provide electrical connections, and support thermal and mechanical stability.

1. Leadframe Packages

DIP (Dual In-line Package): A rectangular package with two rows of pins for through-hole mounting.

QFN (Quad Flat No-lead): A compact surface-mount package with no leads, using pads underneath.

Leadframe-CSP: A chip-scale package built on a leadframe for minimal size and cost.

Leadframe-QFP: A flat package with leads on all four sides, using a leadframe base.

2. Laminate Packages

Wire bond PBGA: A plastic BGA package using wire bonding to connect the die to the substrate.

Flip chip PBGA: A BGA package using flip-chip bonding for better electrical performance.

PBGA (Plastic Ball Grid Array): A cost-effective BGA package with plastic encapsulation.

LGA (Land Grid Array): A package with flat contact pads instead of pins for board-level connection.

# Nomenclature of Packaging
This graphic provides a structured overview of modern semiconductor packaging technologies and how different types of chips (single, multi-chip, SoCs, chiplets, etc.) are integrated with package substrates and ultimately connected to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB).

Once the package is assembled, it is placed onto the PCB. The PCB provides:

. System-level integration

. Power and data communication

. Final product form factor

# Module 2:

# From Silicon Wafer to Complete Package â€“ Assembly and Fabrication Processes

# Review of the Supply Chain
This outlines the key stages in the semiconductor supply chain, detailing the flow from initial design to the final product

. Design House: The process begins with designing integrated circuits (ICs) using EDA tools and foundry PDKs. The output is an IC design file (GDSII) and a test program.

. Wafer Fabrication: Silicon wafers are manufactured using specialized equipment, gases, chemicals, and materials. The result is a wafer with fabricated ICs.

. Package Assembly and Test: Individual ICs are separated from the wafer, assembled into packages with substrates and other materials, and tested for quality.

. Board Assembly and Test: Multiple packaged ICs are mounted onto printed circuit boards (PCBs), assembled using various tools and materials, and then tested.

. Product Assembly and Test: The final stage involves assembling the tested boards and other components into the end product, such as a smartphone, which undergoes final testing before reaching the market.

Each stage is crucial for ensuring the performance and reliability of the final electronic product.

# Wire Bond Packaging Process in Semiconductor Manufacturing

This process is part of the back-end semiconductor manufacturing flow, where individual dies are packaged and made ready for integration on PCBs.

KEY STEPS:

1.Die Attach

  . Epoxy is dispensed.

  . The chip is picked and placed onto a substrate using Die Attach Film (DAF).

2.Curing

  . The epoxy is hardened by controlled heating to ensure strong bonding between die and substrate.

3.Wire Bonding

  . Fine gold or aluminum wires connect the die to the package pins using ultrasonic welding and thermal compression.

4.Molding (Transfer Molding)

  . The assembly is encapsulated using a mold compound, protecting the die and wires with resin flow.

5.Marking

  . The package is laser-marked for identification and traceability.

6.Singulation

  . The wafer is diced into individual packaged units using a precision blade.
